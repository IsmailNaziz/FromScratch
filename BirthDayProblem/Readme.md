The problem is the following:
you have a set of students with different birthdays.
return False if no students have the same birthday
otherwise return True

Input: dict: key => str student Name, value => datetime.date Object Birthday

Find a solution to this problem, the most efficient one is preferred.


Bonus: output a list containing all the pairs of students with the same birthday
if 3 have the same age return a tuple with 3 elements and so on....
if no pairs found return empty list
